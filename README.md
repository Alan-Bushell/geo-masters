## UX

<a name="ux"></a>
### Pre-project Planning
>


# UX design

## Strategy Plane

### To determine the best approach to this project I started with to determine the user needs.

## User Stories

### User
> As a user I want to be able to play a fun and interesting game  
> As a user I want have a choice of what type of game I would like to play
> As a user I want to get a score from the quiz to mark my progress 
> As a user I want to be able to see the rules for the quiz before I start  
> As a user I want to play again when I complete the quiz

## Scope Plane
> The website should have a clear path from initial load to quiz

# Features Left to implement
> Add a high score tracker for the user
> Be able to input username to push to a leaderboard

### Additional ideas

> Ideally I would like to add more complex quizzes and offer a range of topics related to the overarching theme.
> One prospective idea was to find popular tourist locations on googlestreet view and allow the user brief moments to slightly pan and decide where they are.
> Ability to allow a user to complete a specific quiz and share the same version of the quiz with a friend as a form of head 2 head competition.

 2. I then selected the `Pages` menu on the side bar.
